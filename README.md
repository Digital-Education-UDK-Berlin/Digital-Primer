# Digital-Primer
 In this repository You will find some necessary software bricks which will allow You to create Your own variant of a digital Primer (DP). DP is a new kind of medium whose raison d'etre is to educate. Its ideal hardware embodiment looks like a book and has multiple properties of a book. Instead of using screens, device uses e-ink displays (mostly using IT8951 controller) to present visual or textual content. Strong emphasis is to be put on speech technologies (automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis) and touchless human-machine interaction. Recommended platform: Raspberry Pi Zero running Raspbian OS.
